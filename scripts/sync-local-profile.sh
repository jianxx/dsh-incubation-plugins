# Mirror this repo's @jianxx/* packages into a dsh profile's node_modules so
# an unpublished local build boots exactly like the published bundles would.
#
# Why copies, not symlinks: Node resolves modules from a package's realpath.
# A symlinked package would realpath back into this repo, where every
# `import '@deepseek-ai/...'` resolves through our devDep link: into the
# sibling deepseek-harness checkout — a second cordis instance per process.
# Flat copies under the profile instead resolve @deepseek-ai/* through the
# installer-maintained ~/.dsh/profiles/node_modules symlink fallback, which is
# precisely how published bundles share the installation's single cordis
# (README "How the loading works", point 4).
#
# Usage:
#   pnpm run build                       # emit lib/ first
#   bash scripts/sync-local-profile.sh [profile]     # default: web
# then register the two bundles in <profile>/package.json
# dsh.profile.bundles (after the in-box bundles; do NOT add dependencies
# entries — the dsh plugin reconciler never touches bundles that aren't
# dependencies, so hand-registered entries survive).
#
# Re-run after every `pnpm run build` and restart dsh to pick up code changes.
# (Only patch layers are hot-reloaded; plugin code is read at boot.)
