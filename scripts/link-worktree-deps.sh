# Make a git worktree usable for pnpm without a full reinstall.
#
# `claude --worktree` (and `git worktree add`) produce a clean checkout that
# contains only git-tracked files — node_modules/, dist/, coverage/ are all
# gitignored and therefore absent, so every pnpm command in the worktree
# (typecheck, test, build) fails with "Cannot find module". None of them need
# dist: tsconfig.base.json `paths` maps @jianxx/dsh-incubation-* specifiers to
# source, and vitest.config.ts (vite-tsconfig-paths) resolves the same specifiers.
#
# What's missing is node_modules — plural. pnpm's workspace layout installs each
# package's direct deps into that package's own node_modules (nested under
# packages/<category>/<package>/node_modules here), so
# symlinking only the root node_modules leaves per-package deps unresolvable.
# This script discovers every node_modules in the main checkout and symlinks
# each one at the same relative path in the worktree. pnpm's node_modules are
# themselves forests of symlinks into a global content-addressable store, so
# this is instant, zero extra disk, and zero install wait.
